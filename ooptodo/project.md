To-Do application and perform the following steps:

Define a Python class, let’s call it Task, that represents a single task. It should have attributes such as a unique identifier, a description, and a state.

Implement the required methods in the Task class, allowing users to modify the task’s description and state.

Create a separate class, let’s call it ToDoList, that manages a collection of tasks. This class should have methods to add new tasks, edit existing tasks, and remove tasks from the To-Do list.

Implement a user interface that allows users to interact with the ToDoList and perform operations such as adding, editing, and removing tasks. Display the current state of each task and provide options to update the state.

Utilize type hints and type checking in your code to ensure the integrity of data types and minimize potential errors.

By successfully completing these tasks, you will have created a functional To-Do application in Python that meets the requirements of task management and state tracking.

You should have at least 3 different files
main.py
todolist.py
task.py
