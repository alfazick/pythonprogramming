Application Structure
Here's how we'll organize our note-taking application:

bash
Copy code
note_taking_app/
│
├── __init__.py
├── app.py          # The main application module
├── notes.py        # Module to manage note operations
└── storage.py      # Module to handle note storage
__init__.py: Makes note_taking_app a Python package.
app.py: This is the entry point of our application, handling user input and output.
notes.py: Contains the logic for creating, updating, reading, and deleting notes.
storage.py: Manages storing and retrieving notes from a simple file system-based storage.
